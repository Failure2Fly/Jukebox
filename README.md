## How to navigate this project
#### The Code
- Currently there is quite a bit in the repository that is not needed. All that is important is the Music folder, coin.js, global.css, index.js, and the index.html.

#### The Site
- It is set up to look like a old time jukebox. 60-70's era I suppose. The top displays all songs as well as button/number combo. 
- The bottom contains the info on what to do, the buttons and numbers, as well as a display showing the song and info. There is also a css coin.
- At the right side of the buttons, we have the right and left buttons which sort though more song options

## Why I built this project
- I very much enjoy listening to music and haven't done a project with any music yet. I was curious if there was such a website like this out there that mimics a jukebox, and when I did not see one, I decided to make one.

## How I worked on this project
- I worked with CSS Grid for the first time. I found a nice site that helped me [Layoutit](https://www.layoutit.com/)
- I personally added my own music files into a folder, and used them for the audio.
- I worked on functions that would take the number and letter buttons, put them in a combo and select the proper song within an object. 
- I Made sure that when you press an option it can not be depressed until the song it over.
- I worked on a countdown timer function that would countdown the song.

## Improvements I plan on making to this site 
- Improving my CSS animation skills, by making the song pages look more like they are flipping. (As a real jukebox would)\
- Working with an database where I could store songs instead.
- Work with Spotify or other music API's, where users can create there own jukebox. 
- Possibly make a small version of this. Where you can have 10 songs total and put it on your website or something. (Thing Myspace, how you could have songs playing on your page.)

##### New skills, I would like to gain from this site
- Animation skills
- Working with API's
- Transfer to React Native and make into a mobile app.
